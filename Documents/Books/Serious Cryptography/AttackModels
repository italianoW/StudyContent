attack-models are a group of group of ways to sum up the ways attackers might attack the cryptography in a way to make the cryptography safer

- enchances protection 
- give a guideline for which kinda attacks it will work on

the idea is to make it harder than needed in order to protect from future breach invasions

  -Kerckhoffs's Principle

the protection of a cipher should be based on the key and not on the data breached seen as ciphertext
