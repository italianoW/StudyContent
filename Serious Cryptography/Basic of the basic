a cipher is the codified form of a plaintext, which can only be interpreted when put back in the form of a plaintext.

cesar's cipher is basically a transposition of letters in which you move the alphabet 3 letters to the right in a way that taking a plaintext
such as "bob" it transposes to "ere", which cannot be interpreted, but can easily be broken.

when codifying we look for something that can't be done by hand bcs it also quantifies the amount of difficulty the broker is gonna have.

there's also one-time pad security which uses XOR for codifying, using 
        P XOR K = C  ;  C XOR K = P 
        P = plaintext; K = key; C = cipher
      the point is that you can't use the same kew for 2 different P's because that would make the finding of K possible
